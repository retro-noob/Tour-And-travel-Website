        <b><u>Airlines Changes & Schedule Changes/Flight Cancellations</b></u><br><br>
        <b>Airline Policy on Schedule Changes:</b><br>
        Airlines all have differing rules and policies regarding schedule changes.<br><br>
        <b>What is a schedule change or cancellation; Why does this happen?</b><br>
        Due to the operational needs of each airline, they often make changes to the flights that they are currently operating. Often these changes are a prediction of travel needs for a future date but can also reflect same day changes. Types of changes could be: flight number changes, time changes, routing, date changes and or cancellations.<br><br>

        <b>What are Cancellations?</b><br>
        When an airline has stopped or temporarily canceled service to certain cities or has stopped service on certain days of the week.<br><br>

        <b>Reasons for Cancellations or Schedule Changes:</b><br>
        1) Peak or high travel seasons.<br>
        2) Low travel season<br>
        3) Airport Terminal or Gate changes<br>
        4) Acts of God - volcano, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.<br>
        <br>We do not assume any liability whatsoever for cancelled flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting due to any scheduled changes made by the airlines.<br><br>

        <b>Our policy on schedule changes:</b><br>
        We make every attempt to notify the customer of any schedule changes. It is always best to contact the airline to reconfirm your flights within 72 hours of departure.<br><br>
        
        <b>Airline-Initiated Schedule Change(s):</b><br>
        Airlines sometimes initiate involuntary schedule changes due to a variety of reasons, such as changes in travel time, layover time, travel date, flight number, terminal changes, etc. These changes are made by the airline and are outside of our control. Some of these changes may be last-minute and/or occur while you are in transit.<br>
        If your airline initiates change to your flight itinerary, you will not be charged for change fees or differences in airfare.<br><br>
        <b>Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs)</b><br>
        If you booked your flight with a LCC, such as Frontier or Spirit, please contact your airline directly regarding any change in schedule. Our agents are unable to assist you with any changes to LCC bookings.<br>
        Otherwise, you and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and us, including our agents or any representatives acting on our behalf, arising out of or relating on Call with these Terms & Conditions, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or our relationship in connection on Call or these or previous versions of these Terms & Conditions (each, a "Claim"), shall be resolved in accordance with one of the subsections of this Resolution of Disputes section below or as otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing.<br><br>
        
        <b>GOVERNING LAW; CLAIMS</b><br>
        These Terms & Conditions and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, any Claim must be brought within two (2) years from the date on which such Claim arose or accrued. The preceding sentence does not apply to New Jersey residents.<br>
        
        <br><b>WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY AND CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, AND PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.

        <br><b>MANDATORY ARBITRATION</b><br>
        Any and all Claims shall be resolved via binding arbitration initiated through JAMS except for claims asserted on an individual basis that are properly filed in a small claims court or other court of competent jurisdiction having a jurisdictional limit of USD $10,000 or less.<br>
        The arbitration will be governed by the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the "JAMS Rules") and the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by JAMS. The JAMS Rules and Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available online at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. If you initiate arbitration and the total amount in controversy is USD $100,000 or less, the only fee you shall be required to pay is US$250 (which is less than the current standard JAMS filing fee); all other costs will be borne by the Company. In the event that the arbitrator determines that the claims were frivolous, the arbitrator may award to the prevailing party the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration, except that, in arbitrations proceeding in Delaware, the arbitrator is not empowered to award the prevailing party the fees and costs it incurred in connection with the arbitration.<br>
        Notwithstanding the provision above with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms & Conditions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Sec. 1-16, and the "FAA") and any dispute about the interpretation of this arbitration clause shall be covered by the FAA. JAMS and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator approved by or otherwise affiliated with JAMS; except that if the total amount in controversy is more than US$100,000, either party may request a panel of three arbitrators; (b) the party initiating the arbitration shall choose the form in which they would like the arbitration to be conducted: via telephone, online, solely based on written submissions, or at an in-person hearing; (c) notwithstanding the foregoing, if either party requests an in-person hearing: (i) the arbitrator shall decide whether a hearing is necessary or whether the arbitration should proceed via telephone, online or solely based on written submissions, (ii) if the arbitrator deems that a hearing is necessary, the hearing shall occur at a mutually agreed upon location, or, if the parties are unable to agree on a location, at a location that is selected by the arbitrator and is reasonably convenient to all parties, and (iii) either party may elect to participate in an in-person hearing by phone, unless the arbitrator decides otherwise; (d) the arbitrator may not award any: (i) incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits, or (ii) punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages described in subparagraphs (d) (i) and (d) (ii); (e) the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's claim; and (f) unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br>
        <br><b>IMPROPERLY FILED CLAIMS</b><br>
        All claims filed or brought that are not in accordance with to this section shall be considered improperly filed. Should a claim be filed by either you or us in manner that is not in accordance with this section, the other party may seek to recover attorneys' fees and costs up to USD $5,000, provided that the other party has been notified in writing of the improperly filed claim, received fourteen days to withdraw such claim, and fails to do so.<br>
